# HackerOne Report: Arbitrary read on s3://shopify-delivery-app-storage/files
**Report ID:** 94087
**Vulnerability Class:** Improper Authentication - Generic

## Vulnerability Information & PoC
Short
====
An attacker is able to read arbitrary files from the delivery app storage if the bucket key is known to him.

Vector
====
1) The victim uploads a.png to a product his shop located at https://myhackeronestore.myshopify.com.
1a) The file is stored at s3://shopify-delivery-app-storage/files/myhackeronestore.myshopify.com/5682196162/a.png
2) The attacker uploads b.png to a product in his shop (location irrelevant) and changes the 'attachment[filepath]' parameter from "b.png" to "b.png/../../../../files/myhackeronestore.myshopify.com/5682196162/a.png" in the initial call to /attachments.
3) The attacker will now go ahead an generate a manual download link for his newly created attachment
3a) When he visits the generated manual download link the site will state "b.png/../../../../files/myhackeronestore.myshopify.com/5682196162/a.png" as the file name
3b) When the attacker proceeds to press the download button he'll get a working link to get a.png from the victim.

What's wrong here
====
The attacker is able to craft the bucket key in a way to use path traversals (and possibly other wired things related to AWS S3 key names) to get files he shouldn't have access to. 

How it should be
====
In an ideal world the delivery app should control 100% of the bucket key name to make sure no harm can be done by attacks like this. This could be achieved by having a mapping from uploaded_filename to actual_key_in_s3 (is there a way to tell S3 how the downloaded file should be named?). 

Conclusion
====
In my book this is fraud and shouldn't be there ;) You might consider the approach to control 100% of the bucket key to rule an entire class of bugs/vulnerabilities here out as filtering of the filename is tricky and will probably fail (now or in the near feature, who knows what S3 offers as a neat new 'feature' in the future).  Also there are just too many variants on how things could get wrong, what comes to mind is: Encoding interpretation failures on the app side, hidden/not well documented features on the AWS side,...
