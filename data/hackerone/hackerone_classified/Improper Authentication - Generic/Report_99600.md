**Report ID:** 99600
**Vulnerability Class:** Improper Authentication - Generic

## Vulnerability Information & PoC
Hi Team,

You can tweet from your ad account while creating a campaign.When you add a media content from your computer and upload it there is a Json request which gives you the link of your media(Photos) to preview before Tweeting.This link is Vulnerable to IDOR Attack and it leads to disclose all the media content of twitter.I have checked and verified that it discloses the media content of any user's Direct messages and also protected tweets.

Vulnerable HTTP request : 

GET /media_id_to_cdn_url.json?media_id=[Media_id]&_=1447455982153 HTTP/1.1

Here Media_id is vulnerable to IDOR attack and it leads to give you the exact link of the Media content(Photos).
