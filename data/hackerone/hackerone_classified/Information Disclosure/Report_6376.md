# HackerOne Report: User guessing/enumeration at sw.khanacademy.org
**Report ID:** 6376
**Vulnerability Class:** Information Disclosure

## Vulnerability Information & PoC
Hi there,

I've discovered a possibility to check whether a specific email address is associated with an account at  sw.khanacademy.org. An attacker could use this issue to gather some information about his victim.

###Details

```
- Host: sw.khanacademy.org
- URL: https://sw.khanacademy.org/forgotpw
- Affected parameter: email
```

###Steps to reproduce

1. Open the url ```https://sw.khanacademy.org/forgotpw```
2. Enter the email address you'd like to check. (e.g. test@test.de)
3. Submit the form
4. The application will report an error that the email address wasn't found.

If the email address existed in the database, there would not be an error, but a success message that a reset link was sent or something. 

###PoC:

```
POST /forgotpw HTTP/1.1
Host: sw.khanacademy.org
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:28.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/28.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: https://sw.khanacademy.org/forgotpw
Cookie: [COOKIES]
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 41

email=test%40test.de&reset=Reset+password
```

###How to fix?
The application should always return a message like "If the email was found in the database, you'll receive a reset token soon." 
This leaves no information about the association between the application and the email/user.

Best regards,
