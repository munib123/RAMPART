# HackerOne Report: Password reset token leakage through referrer at https://app.c2fo.com/password/reset/
**Report ID:** 5691
**Vulnerability Class:** Information Disclosure

## Vulnerability Information & PoC
Hi there,

another bug I came across. There's a possible password reset token leakage on the password reset page. 

###Steps to reproduce

1. Go to https://app.c2fo.com/password-reset and request a new password (with your existing test account)
2. Click on the password reset link which you'll receive via email

The url bar should look like that: ```https://app.c2fo.com/password/reset/XXXX0de607bdbc2df949a7da49fabcfXXXXX```

So far so good.  You should see the logo of "Truste certified blabla" at the bottom. 

The logo is linked to the following url: ```https://privacy.truste.com/privacy-seal/Pollen,-Inc-/validation?rid=46f28cc9-128f-431a-8fff-6d19427150d9```. 

As you can see it's a link from a "https" page to a "https" url. That means that the referrer will be send to the target. That means that the password reset token will be leaked to the "truste"-company through the referrer.

Clicking on the logo should send the following request (including the referrer):

```
GET /privacy-seal/Pollen,-Inc-/validation?rid=46f28cc9-128f-431a-8fff-6d19427150d9 HTTP/1.1
Host: privacy.truste.com
[...snip...]
Referer: https://app.c2fo.com/password/reset/XXXX0de607bdbc2df949a7da49fabcfXXXXX
[...snip...]
Connection: keep-alive
```

A bad boy webmaster at the "truste"-company could collect the reset urls/token from the access.log.

###How to fix
I'd recommend to either remove the logo from this particular page or remove the link to the third-party company. 

Best regards,
Sebastian
