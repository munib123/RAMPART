# HackerOne Report: Adding profile picture to anyone on Vimeo
**Report ID:** 43617
**Vulnerability Class:** Violation of Secure Design Principles

## Vulnerability Information & PoC
Hi!

**Brief**
The profile picture upload feature at https://vimeo.com/settings/profile contains a bug where an access control is missing for uploading a profile picture to a profile ID. This leads to the possibility of uploading a profile picture to any account on Vimeo. Furthermore, since the upload doesn't have any rate limiting, it would in theory be possible to add a picture to every Vimeo account that exists (since the profile IDs are incremental).

**PoC**
1. Set up an intercepting proxy so that you can edit requests/responses to Vimeo
2. Visit https://vimeo.com/settings/profile
3. Click the "Upload" button
4. Choose any image
5. If you did everything correct, your browser should now send a request to /upload/_get_image_url with 2 post parameters. One of them is called "id". Change this id to another profile id then forward the request.
6. Your uploaded picture is now added to the other profile!

**Remediation**
The profile picture upload function should only work for the currently logged in users profile ID.
