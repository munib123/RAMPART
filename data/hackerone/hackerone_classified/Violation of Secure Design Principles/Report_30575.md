# HackerOne Report: Missing Function Level Access Control in /cindex.php/widget/customize/
**Report ID:** 30575
**Vulnerability Class:** Violation of Secure Design Principles

## Vulnerability Information & PoC
Most web applications verify function level access rights before making that functionality visible in the UI. However, applications need to perform the same access control checks on the server when each function is accessed. If requests are not verified, attackers will be able to forge requests in order to access functionality without proper authorization.
