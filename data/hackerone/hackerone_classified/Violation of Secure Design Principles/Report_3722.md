# HackerOne Report: User impersonation is possible with incoming webhooks
**Report ID:** 3722
**Vulnerability Class:** Violation of Secure Design Principles

## Vulnerability Information & PoC
Using the incoming webhook service it is possible to send messages to the team from an arbitrary username. A malicious user could modify the image of the webhook service to match an existing user and then send a message with the username of an existing user. Other users would not be able to tell the difference between messages from the real user and a spoofed message unless they actually examined the user/bot.

Example request:

POST /services/hooks/incoming-webhook?token=G98rIOYar6DPwDINWFcBnEXT HTTP/1.1
Host: mailinator.slack.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 87
Connection: keep-alive

payload={"channel": "#general", "username": "TARGET", "text": "I'm a spoofed message!"}


The incoming webhook should not accept username as a parameter, this should be static and stored server-side. At very least a server-side check should verify that the username parameter does not match an existing username.
