# HackerOne Report: RTL override symbol not stripped from file names
**Report ID:** 298
**Vulnerability Class:** Violation of Secure Design Principles

## Vulnerability Information & PoC
Any [U+202E RIGHT-TO-LEFT OVERRIDE](http://codepoints.net/U+202E) (and similar) symbols in file names of uploaded files are not stripped from the file name, causing potentially malicious executables to look like harmless images, for example. This might trick HackerOne panel members into accidentally opening _evil h4x0r filez_.

I’ve attached two files:

* one is named [`insane_in_the_cort[RLO]3pm.exe`](http://mothereff.in/js-escapes#1insane%5fin%5fthe%5fcort%5Cu202E3pm.exe), which gets rendered as `insane_in_the_cortexe.mp3`, making it look like a harmless mp3 file of a well-known Cypress Hill song.
* another is named [`po[RLO]gnp.app`](http://mothereff.in/js-escapes#1po%5Cu202Egnp.app), which gets rendered as `poppa.png`, as if it was just a PNG image.

I’ve also attached a screenshot showing what it looks like after uploading the files.
