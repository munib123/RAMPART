# HackerOne Report: out of bounds read crashes php-cgi
**Report ID:** 73234
**Vulnerability Class:** Uncategorized

## Vulnerability Information & PoC
I found and disclosed CVE-2014-9427 to the PHP dev team on 17 December 2014 (https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=68618) and a patch was committed on 30 December 2014 (http://git.php.net/?p=php-src.git;a=commit;h=f9ad3086693fce680fbe246e4a45aa92edd2ac35) and the flaw is now fixed.

Details of the flaw: sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in the CGI component in PHP through 5.4.36, 5.5.x through 5.5.20, and 5.6.x through 5.6.4, when mmap is used to read a .php file, does not properly consider the mapping's length during processing of an invalid file that begins with a # character and lacks a newline character, which causes an out-of-bounds read and might (1) allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from php-cgi process memory by leveraging the ability to upload a .php file or (2) trigger unexpected code execution if a valid PHP script is present in memory locations adjacent to the mapping.
