7.after pasting just refresh the page and thats done you are now logged into your account without login details...

problems faced

the problems face if the vulnerability exits are
1.anyone can easily hijack victims or users session and get into his account
2.cookie stealing is the best way the hacker can get into and account..it would not take more than 5min to steal someones cookie using php n all...
3.even friends can fool the victim and get him hacked..

Solution

Manage session properly.this problem is mainly faced because the session doesn't get expired or doesn't get closed when logout is pressed.each time the user logins the cookie must hold a unique different session id to proceed..

facebook,google,any many more sites overtook this site....
