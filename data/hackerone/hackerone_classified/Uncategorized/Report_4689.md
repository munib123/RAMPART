# HackerOne Report: SPDY memory corruption
**Report ID:** 4689
**Vulnerability Class:** Uncategorized

## Vulnerability Information & PoC
A bug in the experimental SPDY implementation in nginx 1.5.10 was found, which might allow an attacker to corrupt worker process memory by using a specially crafted request, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution (CVE-2014-0088).

The problem only affects nginx 1.5.10 on 32-bit platforms, compiled with the ngx_http_spdy_module module (which is not compiled by default), if the "spdy" option of the "listen" directive is used in a configuration file.

The problem is fixed in nginx 1.5.11.

Patch for the problem can be found here:
