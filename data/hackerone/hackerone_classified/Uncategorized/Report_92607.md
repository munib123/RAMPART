# HackerOne Report: Content spoofing on invitations page 
**Report ID:** 92607
**Vulnerability Class:** Uncategorized

## Vulnerability Information & PoC
When you are an owner of a program on h1 , you are allowed to invite external users to access any report through email . As you invite someone , this is how the body of invitation is being sent through email :-

[link to researcher's profile] invited you to join the bug [Title Of The Bug]  for [Name of the program]

So being an owner of a program I control  [Title Of The Bug] and [Name of the program] . So I can create any program on h1 , report a bug to it , keeping the Title of that bug and name of my program as per my choice .

This is how a Verified program on h1 can spoof the body of the email leading to phishing attacks but i suppose h1 trusts all of the verified programs so this may not be a risk .

For the Unverified programs , as you invite an external user , the body of email also contains a warning which minimizes the risk of further phishing attacks BUT it's not necessary to invite someone ONLY through emails ....
For eg.
1. Attacker creates a program , reports a bug to it choosing the title of bug and name of the program as in the attached screenshot .
2.  He then sends a mail to himself thus getting an invitation id !
3. He can then personally invite someone through that invitation .
