# HackerOne Report: XSS when using captions/subtitles on video player based on Flash (requires user interaction)
**Report ID:** 88508
**Vulnerability Class:** Cross-site Scripting (XSS) - Generic

## Vulnerability Information & PoC
__Description__

The video player based on Flash (not the HTML5 one), shows the captions/subtitles without escaping. This allows to upload a file with captions/subtitles with HTML code, because the content of the file is not escaped when it's stored.
The way to force the use of the Flash player is using the widget Hubnut, because on Chrome for example the default player is the HTML5 one.
