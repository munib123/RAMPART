**Language:** c
**Source:** CrossVul dataset (`hitoshura25/crossvul`, file pair `3013_0`)

## Vulnerability Information & PoC

## Description
Use After Free - The use of previously-freed memory can have any number of adverse consequences, ranging from the corruption of valid data to the execution of arbitrary code, depending on the instantiation and timi...
