## Vulnerability Information & PoC

## Description
Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') - This can have security implications when the expected synchronization is in security-critical code, such as recording whether a user is authenticated or modifying important state information that s...

	 * into the on-disk inode when writing inodes out, instead of i_size.

	 * The only time when i_disksize and i_size may be different is when

	 * data tree are chopped off during truncate. We can't do that in
	 * ext4 because whenever we perform intermediate commits during
	 * truncate, the inode and all the metadata blocks *must* be in a
