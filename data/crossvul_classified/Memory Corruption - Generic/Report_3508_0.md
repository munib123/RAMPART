# CrossVul Fix Pair: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer in c
**Pair ID:** 3508_0
**Vulnerability Class:** Memory Corruption - Generic
**CWE:** CWE-119
**Language:** c
**Source:** CrossVul dataset (`hitoshura25/crossvul`, file pair `3508_0`)

## Vulnerability Information & PoC

## Description
Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer - Certain languages allow direct addressing of memory locations and do not automatically ensure that these locations are valid for the memory buffer that is being referenced.

## Vulnerable Code
```c
Lines 1519-1559 of the vulnerable file.

	if (len == 0) {
		int i = 0;

		do {
			udelay(2);
			barrier();
			len = le16_to_cpu(rxhdr->frame_len);
		} while (len == 0 && i++ < 5);
		if (unlikely(len == 0)) {
			dmaaddr = meta->dmaaddr;
			goto drop_recycle_buffer;
		}
	}
	if (unlikely(b43_rx_buffer_is_poisoned(ring, skb))) {
		/* Something went wrong with the DMA.
		 * The device did not touch the buffer and did not overwrite the poison. */
		b43dbg(ring->dev->wl, "DMA RX: Dropping poisoned buffer.\n");
		dmaaddr = meta->dmaaddr;
		goto drop_recycle_buffer;
	}
	if (unlikely(len > ring->rx_buffersize)) {
		/* The data did not fit into one descriptor buffer
		 * and is split over multiple buffers.
		 * This should never happen, as we try to allocate buffers
		 * big enough. So simply ignore this packet.
		 */
		int cnt = 0;
		s32 tmp = len;

		while (1) {
			desc = ops->idx2desc(ring, *slot, &meta);
			/* recycle the descriptor buffer. */
			b43_poison_rx_buffer(ring, meta->skb);
			sync_descbuffer_for_device(ring, meta->dmaaddr,
						   ring->rx_buffersize);
			*slot = next_slot(ring, *slot);
			cnt++;
			tmp -= ring->rx_buffersize;
			if (tmp <= 0)
				break;
		}
