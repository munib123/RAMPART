# CrossVul Fix Pair: Improper Input Validation in c
**Pair ID:** 5660_0
**Vulnerability Class:** Improper Input Validation
**CWE:** CWE-20
**Language:** c
**Source:** CrossVul dataset (`hitoshura25/crossvul`, file pair `5660_0`)

## Vulnerability Information & PoC

## Description
Improper Input Validation - Input validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with othe...

## Vulnerable Code
```c
Lines 804-844 of the vulnerable file.

fail:
	IP6_INC_STATS(net, ip6_dst_idev(skb_dst(skb)),
		      IPSTATS_MIB_FRAGFAILS);
	kfree_skb(skb);
	return err;
}

static inline int ip6_rt_check(const struct rt6key *rt_key,
			       const struct in6_addr *fl_addr,
			       const struct in6_addr *addr_cache)
{
	return (rt_key->plen != 128 || !ipv6_addr_equal(fl_addr, &rt_key->addr)) &&
		(addr_cache == NULL || !ipv6_addr_equal(fl_addr, addr_cache));
}

static struct dst_entry *ip6_sk_dst_check(struct sock *sk,
					  struct dst_entry *dst,
					  const struct flowi6 *fl6)
{
	struct ipv6_pinfo *np = inet6_sk(sk);
	struct rt6_info *rt = (struct rt6_info *)dst;

	if (!dst)
		goto out;

	/* Yes, checking route validity in not connected
	 * case is not very simple. Take into account,
	 * that we do not support routing by source, TOS,
	 * and MSG_DONTROUTE 		--ANK (980726)
	 *
	 * 1. ip6_rt_check(): If route was host route,
	 *    check that cached destination is current.
	 *    If it is network route, we still may
	 *    check its validity using saved pointer
	 *    to the last used address: daddr_cache.
	 *    We do not want to save whole address now,
	 *    (because main consumer of this service
	 *    is tcp, which has not this problem),
	 *    so that the last trick works only on connected
	 *    sockets.
	 * 2. oif also should be the same.
