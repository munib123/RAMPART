# CrossVul Fix Pair: Improper Input Validation in c
**Pair ID:** 1276_2
**Vulnerability Class:** Improper Input Validation
**CWE:** CWE-20
**Language:** c
**Source:** CrossVul dataset (`hitoshura25/crossvul`, file pair `1276_2`)

## Vulnerability Information & PoC

## Description
Improper Input Validation - Input validation is a frequently-used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with othe...

## Vulnerable Code

  /* If the query is DISTINCT with an ORDER BY but is not an aggregate, and 
  ** if the select-list is the same as the ORDER BY list, then this query
  ** can be rewritten as a GROUP BY. In other words, this:
  **
  **     SELECT DISTINCT xyz FROM ... ORDER BY xyz
  **
  ** is transformed to:
  **
  **     SELECT xyz FROM ... GROUP BY xyz ORDER BY xyz
  **
  ** The second form is preferred as a single index (or temp-table) may be 
  ** used for both the ORDER BY and DISTINCT processing. As originally 
  ** written the query must use a temp-table for at least one of the ORDER 
  ** BY and DISTINCT, and an index or separate temp-table for the other.
